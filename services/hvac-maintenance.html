                <img src="../images/alliance-mini-split.jpg" alt="Benefits of HVAC maintenance" class="content-image image-left">
                
                <h3>Improved Energy Efficiency</h3>
                <p>Well-maintained HVAC systems operate more efficiently, consuming less energy while providing better comfort. Clean coils, proper airflow, and calibrated controls can reduce energy consumption by 15-20%, resulting in significant utility bill savings. Our maintenance services ensure your system operates at manufacturer-specified efficiency levels.</p>
                
                <h3>Extended Equipment Lifespan</h3>
                <p>Regular maintenance significantly extends the life of your HVAC equipment. Properly maintained systems typically last 5-10 years longer than neglected equipment, maximizing your investment and delaying costly replacement decisions. Our preventive care protects your valuable HVAC assets.</p>
                
                <h3>Reduced Repair Costs</h3>
                <p>Preventive maintenance identifies and addresses minor issues before they become major, expensive repairs. Early detection and correction of problems like refrigerant leaks, worn belts, or dirty filters prevents system damage and reduces overall repair costs by up to 40%.</p>
                
                <h3>Better Indoor Air Quality</h3>
                <p>Clean filters, coils, and ductwork improve indoor air quality by removing allergens, dust, and other contaminants. Our maintenance services include comprehensive cleaning and filter replacement, creating healthier indoor environments for your family or employees.</p>
                
                <h3>Warranty Protection</h3>
